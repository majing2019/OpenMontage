# Script Director - Hybrid Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage maps the story across source-led beats and support-led beats. You are deciding where the source carries the message and where support assets clarify it.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/script.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifact | `state.artifacts["idea"]["brief"]` | Anchor medium and deliverable mix |
| Tools | `transcriber`, `scene_detect`, `audio_enhance` | Optional source analysis |

## Process

### 1. Mark Source-Led Versus Support-Led Beats

For each section, state whether it is:

- carried by source dialogue or footage,
- carried by narration,
- carried by diagrams or overlays,
- carried by text only.

### 2. Use Source Speech When It Is Better Than Rewriting

If the supplied footage already contains strong lines, use `transcriber` and keep the authenticity. Do not replace good source material with unnecessary narration.

### 3. Use Support Only To Clarify

Support-led beats should answer:

- what is not visible,
- what needs summarizing,
- what needs emphasis,
- what changes for a different platform.

### 4. Use Metadata For Structure

Recommended metadata keys:

- `anchor_sections`
- `support_sections`
- `narration_sections`
- `required_support_assets`

### 5. Quality Gate

- source-led beats are clearly marked,
- support-led beats are justified,
- the script does not depend on fake or unavailable assets without saying so,
- the structure can produce the intended deliverables.

### Mid-Production Fact Verification

If you encounter uncertainty during script writing:
- Use `web_search` to verify factual claims before committing them to the script
- Use `web_search` to find reference images for visual accuracy
- Log verification in the decision log: `category="visual_accuracy_check"`

Every factual claim in the script should be traceable to the `research_brief`.
If you make a claim that isn't in the research, do additional research and
add the source. Do not invent statistics, dates, or attributions.

## Common Pitfalls

- Rewriting strong source dialogue into weaker narration.
- Adding diagrams or cards where the footage already explains the point.
- Hiding unsupported requirements until asset generation.

## Universal Quality Enhancements

### Therefore/But Connection Test

> Source: William Akers "Your Screenplay Sucks!" (2008)

Every beat/scene transition must connect via **"therefore"** (causal) or **"but"** (contradiction) — never "and then."

**Quick test**: Between any two consecutive beats, mentally insert "therefore" or "but." If neither word fits naturally, the beats aren't connected strongly enough. Revise one beat so a causal or contrasting link emerges.

| Connection | Meaning | Effect on Audience |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Therefore | Beat B is a consequence of Beat A | Forward narrative drive |
| But | Beat B contradicts Beat A's expectation | Tension, surprise, engagement |
| And then | No logical connection | Confusion, disengagement |

### Information Gap Per Beat

> Source: Storr "The Science of Storytelling" (2019), Heath brothers "Made to Stick" (2007)

Each beat should either **open a new information gap** or **partially close an existing gap** — but never fully close all gaps until the climax.

- **Beat opening a gap**: Pose a question, hint at something unseen, create an expectation
- **Beat partially closing a gap**: Reveal some information but leave a new question
- **Climax beat**: Close the core dramatic question — this is the only moment all gaps resolve

If a beat neither opens nor closes a gap, it's likely filler. Either add a reveal, a reversal, or cut it.

### 30-Second Emotional Density Rule (60s+ videos)

For scripts longer than 60 seconds, ensure at least one **emotional stimulation point** (reveal, reversal, tone shift, or new information) occurs every ~30 seconds. If a 30-second window has no emotional change, the audience's attention will wane.

### Scene Value Change (McKee)

> Source: Robert McKee "Story" (1997)

Each beat/scene should begin and end in **different emotional polarity** (positive↔negative). If a beat starts and ends in the same state, it adds nothing to the narrative.
